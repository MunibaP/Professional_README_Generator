## Description
In this week challenge #9, I introduce the Professional README Generator – your go-to tool for easy and professional project guides!  As a transitional web developer I was tasked to create a professional README Generator to effortlessly generate professional and comprehensive README files. Professional README Generator simplifies the documentation process, providing a seamless integration of Markdown syntax and essential project details. In addition, it ensures that the README files are not only informative but also visually appealing. Through intuitive prompts and customizable templates, this README generator empowers you to efficiently communicate your project's purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and more. 

## User Story
```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Technologies
The technologies I used in this challenge includes:
1. JavaScript 
2. Node.js
3. Inquirer Package
4. Visual Studio Code(VS-code)
5. Github: Github was used to create a repository which includes the links to the projects, index.js, package.json, and the README file.
6. Gitlab: Gitlab was used to clone the project to our laptop.

## Installation

1. To install the challenge #6, first create a new repository in your GitHub account, and then clone this repository to your local computer.

  To clone: git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
2. Install Node.js [v20.11.0]
3. Open the cloned repository in a visual studio code.
4. Open integrated terminal on index.js in order to run "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" on the command line to install inquirer package and to ensure that "node_modules" and "package.json" are operating on your local device.

## Usage

1. Deploy your code by running "git add", "git commit", and "git push" in your local repository.

2. Visit your GitHub repository online, click 'Settings', and then select 'Pages' on the left.

3. In GitHub Pages, set the 'main' branch as the source and click 'Save'.

4. Access your live site at <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name>. For example, if your username is "lernantino" and your repo is "css-demo-site", the URL is <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
